Defroster
by Trashbang (dm_lister), Reskin by AudioCraZ

Background: Find yourself in an imperfect
temple built for an unknown deity. This advanced
society experimented with teleportation brought by
the voyagers. Their defrosted water flows from the
mouth of this abandoned location as if the people
left their holy cloister at a moment's notice.

Special thanks to Mark Laidlaw,
who originally authored the map cloister.

Special Thanks:
    Joe Wintergreen (https://twitter.com/joewintergreen)
    for being a cool deathmatch tester, and  making some
    helpful suggestions for the final release.

    Marphy Black, for producing the Half-Life Fact Files
    series and, most importantly, the informative video on
    Cloister that prompted this whole mess
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL9sEtADTOo).

    The wonderful folk at TWHL (twhl.info) for maintaining
    a sterling repository of entity references, tutorials,
    and other helpful bits-and-bobs for GoldSrc mapping.

    Daniel Walder (http://logic-and-trick.com/) for creating
    the Sledge editor, a much-needed alternative to Hammer
    that manages to outdo its competition (even with all the
    nasty alpha bugs).

    Sean Cavanaugh and assorted contributors 
    (http://zhlt.info/credits.html) for their work on Zoner's
    Half-Life Tools. Without their augmented functionality,
    this map would've been literally impossible to compile.
    Like, at all.
